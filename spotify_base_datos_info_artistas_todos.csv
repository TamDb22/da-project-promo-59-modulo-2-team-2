一个为爱有所等待的“影子”情人 
2003年，李玖哲以MACHI团员Nicky小胖子的身份进入了华语乐坛，并迅速以其独特的嗓音及讨喜的幽默个性颇受广大年轻歌迷的欢迎；2004年，作为MACHI成员发行了麻吉第二张专辑；在华语乐坛打拼的两年中，李玖哲陆续参与了萧雅轩、阿妹、TENSION、B.A.D.、STANTLY、麻吉弟弟等多位艺人的专辑制作。 
2005年，李玖哲终于以其优美及中低音独特音色，发行了个人第一张国语专辑，为国语乐坛增添一名实至名归的实力派歌手。 
9首深情演绎 2首友情献作 
李玖哲除了努力在自己的歌唱事业上做足准备，最重要的是还有有一群在音乐理念契合与在奋斗过程中相互扶持的朋友。专辑中，除了放置自己的好歌好声音外，还特别放了一首由Nicky作曲、由Gabe演唱的歌曲“弹错”。 
Gabe，1977年 2月19日生，是一个12岁即独自赴美在加拿大念完计算机动画硕士却对音乐有强烈执着的大男生。令人意外的是，他却喜欢念中文书喜欢林夕作品，自己也喜欢填词，是另一个不同的新的质感的麻吉好朋友。 
另外还有一首由大家一直熟识的麻吉基本成员Edward的词曲创作。由Nicky做Vocal Producer的“近情情怯”，是一首Edward和制作人阿弟仔共同亲近上帝的美好经验，因为离上帝不远，所以一切不能忍耐的都变成了另一种甜蜜负担的试验。 
个人专辑中放入其它人的歌曲当Bonus，是国语唱片中少见的作法，但基于将好声音介绍给大家的迫切心情，所以，唱片公司试着做了一个这样的尝试，希望这样的初试啼声和见面方式，可以与大家搭起音乐无国界的友谊桥梁！ 
首波如影相随主打：影子 
李玖哲，一个擅长用声音抓住回忆的歌手。影子这首歌是描写Nicky自己在18岁青春年少时，移民美国的他私心的一意想往韩国实现做音乐的梦想，而迫不得已和他深爱的女孩分开。事过境迁，选择给对方祝福，希望永远都能成为彼此心里一股熟悉的力量而产生的歌。 
编曲偏向简单干净的处理，乐器配置上选用钢琴及鼓，有着比较正统的R&B编曲方式，只为了突显Nicky的嗓音！制作人Jae跟Nicky合作已经八年，也算是Nicky在音乐上的知遇伯乐，非常了解Nicky的声音特质和音域，因而特地为他量身打造这首歌，让他的中高音可以完全发挥。所有合声也都由Nicky自己完成，充分展现出他的丰厚嗓音魅力！ 
男女对唱颠覆价值最推荐：无价快乐 
当一个男人在恋爱时，不能在第一眼就被认定或需要较多考验，“无型男”的天生悲哀立即显现。但这首与Melody对唱、以Nicky个性为主所写的讨喜男女对唱，却将“虽然没有俊俏外表但拥有好个性并秉持（付出比接受快乐）的一贯原则”，做了最贴切的诠释！ 
Melody，麻吉音乐里一个充满阳刚气，健康爽朗的女生，她以甜美的嗓音及唱出漂亮女生并非都是“花瓶”的小女人主见！ 
一个新的好声音，值得一听！ 
挺不住的诱惑推荐：第五街的诱惑 
一首由麻吉好兄弟：Nicky、Edward、Gabe一起跨刀演唱的超热舞曲；此首歌更成为“第五街牛仔裤”的年度广告曲，也是MACHI音乐跨界产品的异业结合，特别配合设计出一系列的硬挺牛仔系列！而一向自嘲是“小胖子”也不爱运动的Nicky为了舞出节奏及穿出牛仔裤的男人气息，硬是减肥10公斤并勤练舞蹈。脱胎换骨的决心，由此可见！ 
深情R&B魅力强推荐：都怪我 
一首硬朗风格的R&B情歌，李玖哲性感的声音被淋漓尽致的表现出来。讲述的是一个从爱情竞争中落败的失意人，小胖子憨厚的样子与深情的嗓音倒是非常适合出演这种内敛的魅力老实人。 
柔情独特嗓音再推荐：洗牌 、解脱 
李玖哲，虽然身为韩国人，却有着如黑人R&B唱腔般漂亮的中音及假音，低音部分又有一种硬朗的感觉，这样的一副好声音，在“洗牌”及“解脱”中，可以好好感受一番！ 
怀抱着知育之恩及满是爱的包围，努力前进想带给大家更多愉快音乐的Nicky，一直以来，都在为自己的梦想独自努力着。身为家中老大，非常感谢爸爸妈妈给他无条件的爱，孝顺的他最大的梦想，是要给妈妈一个有着大花园的家，他一直努力着，为的是对音乐的热切喜爱及家人一份爱的牵绊！当然这其中还包含MACHI大哥黄立成对他的赏识及知遇之恩！因为他知道，大哥对于他的那一番用心良苦与超值的鼓励！
