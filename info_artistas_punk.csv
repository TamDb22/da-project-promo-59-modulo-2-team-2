While his career as a student would prove short-lived, he integrated into Provo and SLC's underground music and art scene, left religion behind, and called his new band ""Choir Boy"". <a href=""https://www.last.fm/music/Choir+Boy"">Read more on Last.fm</a>",140059,2363739,"['Body of Light', 'Drab Majesty', 'Riki', 'SRSQ', 'Korine']"
